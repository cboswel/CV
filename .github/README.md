### Apprenticeship (2020 - 2025)

  Completion of the apprenticeship is a separate award granted by IET. It
  required proof that I have developed the attributes of an incorporated
  engineer as laid out by the UK Engineering Council

### BSc Music Technology, Staffordshire University (2012 - 2015)

  Sparked some interest in electronics in modules about microphone and speaker
  design. When later studying electronics I found many parallels between audio
  processing and signal processing

## Volunteering

### Assisted reading with ARCh (2024 - present)

  I work with young children with reading difficulties to inspire a love of
  reading and to provide a space for one-on-one literacy practice.

### In2Science mentor (2025 - present)

  In2Science is a charity helping disadvantaged groups explore careers in
  science. I mentor an A-level student via video calls to advise skills to
  prioritise and potential career paths.
